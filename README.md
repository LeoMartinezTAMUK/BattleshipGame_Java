# BattleshipGame_Java
Program that simulates the board game "Battleship" and allows the user to attempt to take down opposing ships that are placed in randomized locations each game.
The game will let a player know if they hit, miss, or destroy a ship. The player will have unlimited tries until every ship is destroyed. After every ship is destroyed, the program will let a player know how many attempts(shots) it took for them to win.
The code was written in Java using Atom Text editor while using Ubuntu Linux VM.
