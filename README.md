*** Run the game using DotComBust.java/class ***

Program that simulates the board game "Battleship" and allows the user to attempt to take down opposing ships that are placed in randomized locations each game.
The game will let a player know if they hit, miss, or destroy a ship. The player will have unlimited tries until every ship is destroyed. After every ship is destroyed, the program will let a player know how many attempts(shots) it took for them to win.
The code was written in Java using Atom Text editor while using Ubuntu Linux VM.

The gameboard will consist of a 2D array with the values of A-G descending (vertical Y-axis) and 0-6 left-right (horizontal X-axis).
For example, a user can guess A1, B1, and C1 to take down a ship that is the size of three blocks.
